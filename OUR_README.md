## Potential Variables to try:

Chill Hours: Rough estimate of how many hours in the months of December and January trees were exposed to temperatures below 45 degrees F.

Growing Degree Days: As shown in class

Historical Bloom Dates: Basic linear model

## Next Steps:

Need to extrapolate historic bloom dates for Vancouver;

### To get chill hours 

Need to collect data and find out how many hours each month, especially in December and January, the trees experienced below 45 degrees F.
