## Potential Variables to try:

Chill Hours: Cherry trees require a certain number of hours of exposure to cold temperatures in order to break dormancy and bloom. You could use data on the number of hours the temperature remains below a certain threshold to predict bloom date.

Soil Moisture: The amount of moisture in the soil can affect the timing of bloom, with trees blooming earlier in years with wetter soil conditions. You could use data on soil moisture levels to predict bloom date.

Growing Degree Days: Growing degree days are a measure of accumulated heat that takes into account both the minimum and maximum temperature. This measure could be used as an alternative to accumulated temperature to predict bloom date.

Rainfall: Rainfall can impact the timing of bloom, with heavy rainfall delaying bloom. You could use data on rainfall amounts and timing to predict bloom date.

Bud Development: Observations of the tree's bud development can be used to predict bloom date. You could use historical data on the timing of bud development to create a model for predicting future bloom dates.

Historical Bloom Dates: Historical bloom dates can be used to predict future bloom dates. By examining the relationship between bloom dates and other variables such as temperature, chill hours, and photoperiod, you may be able to create a model that accurately predicts future bloom dates based on past data.

## Next Steps:

### To get chill hours 

Need to collect data and find out how many hours each month, especially in December and January, the trees experienced below 45 degrees F.
